lizard-serious
==========================================

This app was built in a couple of hours during the Lizard event of June 20th, 2012.

It features:

- Spatial evaporation visualization

- Radar imagery converted from raw ASCII to sequenced/animated GIF

- An interactive graph, abstracted from the ASCII data


We built upon lots of existing Lizard apps:

- Lizard WMS: https://github.com/lizardsystem/lizard-wms/

- Lizard Map: https://github.com/lizardsystem/lizard-map/

- Lizard UI: https://github.com/lizardsystem/lizard-ui/

and some more! Have a look: https://github.com/lizardsystem/
